# Nginx as a Web server

### Web server

A web server stores and delivers the content for a website – such as text, images, video, and application data – to clients that request it.

A web server communicates with a client using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol \(HTTP\). The content of most web pages is encoded in Hypertext Markup Language \(HTML\). The content can be static \(for example, text and images\) or dynamic \(for example, a computed price or the list of items a customer has marked for purchase\). To deliver dynamic content, most web servers support server‑side scripting languages to encode business logic into the communication. Commonly supported languages include Active Server Pages \(ASP\), Javascript, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

A web server might also cache content to speed delivery of commonly requested content. This process is also known as _web acceleration_.



In a web browser, the **address bar** \(also **location bar** or **URL bar**\) is a GUI widget that shows the current URL.

A URL is one type of _**U**niform **R**esource **I**dentifier \(**URI**\)_;
